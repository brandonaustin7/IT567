This is a Simple Port Scanner made from Python using sockets.  

This program will take a host input by the user, ask for a range of ports, and scan the TCP ports (UDP if wanted as well)
The program will walk the user through the steps and then at the end, ask the user if he or she wants to scan a different host.

Once the user has finished the program completely, the results are sent off to a pdf file called "myResults"
(The results are also on the command prompt for the user to see right away as well)
